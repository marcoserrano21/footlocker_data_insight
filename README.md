# Project Description (First-Person Point of View)
As part of my application for the Data Analytics Internship at Foot Locker, I created a data-driven project to analyze retail sales data and provide actionable insights for improving customer experience, inventory management, and sustainability. This project reflects my passion for leveraging data to solve real-world business challenges, aligning perfectly with Foot Locker’s mission to innovate and deliver exceptional retail experiences.

Using SQL, Python, and Power BI, I explored key aspects of the business, such as:

Identifying top-selling products and regional sales trends.

Analyzing customer demographics to improve inclusivity in marketing campaigns.

Highlighting opportunities to reduce waste and optimize inventory for sustainability.

Through this project, I demonstrated my ability to clean, analyze, and visualize data, as well as communicate insights effectively to drive decision-making.

Tools Used
SQL: For data cleaning and aggregation.

Python: For advanced analysis and visualization (using Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly).

Power BI: For creating interactive dashboards to present insights.

Process
Data Collection: Used a synthetic retail dataset to simulate Foot Locker’s sales data.

Data Cleaning: Handled missing values and prepared the data for analysis using SQL and Python.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzed sales trends, customer behavior, and product performance using Python visualizations.

Actionable Insights: Identified opportunities for improving sales, reducing waste, and enhancing inclusivity.

Visualization and Storytelling: Created interactive dashboards in Power BI and summarized findings in a presentation.
